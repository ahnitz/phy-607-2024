* Project 1
* Random numbers
    * pseudorandom numbers
        * example with numpy
    * drawing from specific distributions
        * Using the inverse CDF
        * Using rejection sampling
* Monte-carlo
   * example of integration
* [In class exercises]
   * try inverse CDF and rejection sampling with exponential function 
     * compare using a normal or a quadratic function for rejection sampling
       Which is more efficient?
   * Monte-carlo integration
     * Circumference of an ellipse? a = 5, b = 2
    
* [Next class] 
  * Importance Sampling
  * Uncertainties in monte carlo

Project 2 Timeline
        * By Oct 8, find a partner, agree on a project concept
          and submit a plan that includes (1) a description of the simulation
          and (2) psuedocode of the main simulation program and (3) a plan for how
          the work will be divided between the group members. This should
          include what modules need to be written, what the expected functions
          or classes are and what you expect them to do
          (the final implementation can diverge from this). No implementation
          is required at this point.
        * By Oct 15, each group member should have completed their individual
          contributions so that it can be integrated and tested together.
        * Oct 22, full project and report are due
