* Project 2 questions
* Monte-carlo Integrals continued
    * importance sampling
* [in-class exercise] continued
    * Statistical error in ellipse circumference calculation
        * Plot the statistical error as a function of sample size. It should
          scale with N^(1/2).
    * Approximation / Systematic Error
        * Plot the approximation error as a function of the annulus width
* Project 2 breakout
    * Work with your groups to plan out your projects and begin any work.
