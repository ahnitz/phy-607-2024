* Project 2
* function fitting
    * least squares
    * goodness of fit
        * adjusted R^2
* in-class exercise [in groups of 3]
    * (1) develop a model for the data, each group member should try a 
          different model
    * (2) each person should use one of thier minimizers to fit the data
    * (3) test the goodness of fit by calculated the adjusted R^2
    * (4) compare the ability of each model in the group to fit to the
          data
* incorporating noise in your model
    * fitted peak value --> distribution of fits
    * bayes theorem
        * likelihood functions
    * markov chain monte carlo [continue next class]
