    * how to compare models
    * discussion of failure modes
* in-class work
    * use your prewritten likelihood function and priors (of choice)
    * write a 500 walker ensemble MCMC and run for 1000 iterations
    * Plot the distribution of the walker positons after every 100 iterations.
        * How does the distribution evolve?
        * Has the distribution converged?
