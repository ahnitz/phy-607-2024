* spherical cow 
   * drag-free case
       * Assume vx = 1 m/s and vy = 100 m/s, drag = 0, x0=0, y0=1000
       * for dt = .001
       * write a file that contains three columns, space separated
           * time position_x position_y
           * post the file to slack for your group
       * plot x vs y position for the entire trajectory
           * work out and plot the analytic prediction for the trajectory
           * do they agree?
       * Plot the kinetic, potential, and total energy.
           * Is the total energy conserved?
   * air resistance
       * set the drag coefficient to 4
       * Are there conserved quantities? Are there any important limits?
       * Plot the trajectory and post the corresponding trajectory file.
