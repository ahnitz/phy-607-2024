    * how to compare models
    * discussion of failure modes
* in-class work
    * use your likelihood function and priors (of choice)
    * write a 500 walker ensemble MCMC and run for 10000 iterations
    * Plot the distribution of the walker positons after every 100 iterations.
        * How does the distribution evolve?
        * Has the distribution converged?
        * What is the autocorrelation time for each of your parameters?
* Project 3
* identifying conceptual and technical errors
