* Project 1 grades will be available Thursday
* Example algorithms and their computational cost
* time complexity in python
    * https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
* [in-class group work]
    Implement sorting algorithm that works with your extended precision class.
    * Implement both a bubble sort and a merger sort
    * Split the implementation between the group
    * Before next class post a plot comparing the time it takes to sort
      a list for both algorithms as a function of list length from 10^1 to 10^5
      elements.
* Monte-carlo simulations
* numpy arrays
* Random numbers
    * pseudorandom numbers
    * drawing from specific distributions
        * Using the inverse CDF
        * Using rejection sampling
* Project 2 is posted
